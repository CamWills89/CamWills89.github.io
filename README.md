### Introduction
My name is Cameron Wills. I am currently a bootcamp student, learning the art of web development. I am from South Africa, living in Atlanta, GA, USA. 
The purpose of this portfolio is to display my personal bio to whom ever is interested in me for professional reasons. This will hopefully
demonstrate who I am as a professional web developer. It is meant to demonstrate deployed apps/work that I have previously done, my Curriculum Vitae and how to get in contact with me on multiple different platforms.
